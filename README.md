## Description
SVG Logo Maker is a command line program that generates SVG logos based off of user input. Logos generated through this program are very simple, containing one of three shapes (circle, square and triangle), up to three letters of text, and colors for the shape and the text.

## Installation
Navigate to where you want the project to be saved in your command line and clone the GitHub repository with 'git clone'. Be sure to install Node.js if you don't already have it. Once the repository has been downloaded and Node.js is installed, run 'npm install' or 'npm i' on the repository to install all needed dependencies.

## Usage
In the command line, you will be prompted to enter information about your logo, such as shape and color. Answer each of the questions, pressing enter after each answer. Once you've answered all the questions, your logo will be generated and saved in the /svgs directory.
